# Self driving car in pure JS

This was made along with tutorial series [self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY) by [Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://www.youtube.com/c/RaduMariescuIstodor).

Maybe I'll come back later to it someday to improve it a bit.

# Controls

* "Space" - save current best network in LocalStorage.
* "Backspace" - clear current best network, start with random again.
