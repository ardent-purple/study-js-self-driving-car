- connect steering speed to the linear speed of the vehicle
- curved road
- rethink all the trigonometry from the start
- Polygonal borders (for more precise collision detection)
- different amounts of hits to damage the car
- different fitness functions:
  - distance travelled
  - best Y but less shaking sideways
  - closest to the center lane
- parenting mutation between best brains
- less magic numbers, more config constants
- or better yet -- options to control the NN options (amount of cars, mutation strength & so on)
- gradations for controls (not 1 and 0, but 0 -- 1 gradient)
- Lane recognition
